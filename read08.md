#### Functions ####
- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. 
- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value. 
#### object ####
- An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as 
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other). 
- String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
##### There are two components to a decison : #####
1. An expression is evaluated, which returns a value.
2. An conditional statement says what to do in a given situation.
- Evaluating conditions.( == , != , !== , === , > , < , <= , >= )
 ##### USING IF ... ELSE STATEMENTS #####
- An if statement only runs a set of statements if the condition is true.
- An if ... e 1 se statement runs one set of code if the condition is true or a different set if it is fa1se.
##### SWITCH STATEMENTS ######
- A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value.
- Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.
##### SHORT CIRCUIT VALUES #####
- Logical operators are processed left to right.
They short-circuit (stop) as soon as they have a result - but they return the value that stopped the processing (not necessarily true or fa1se). 
- Logical operators will not always return true or false, because: 
• They return the value that stopped processing. 
• That value might have been treated as truthy or falsy although it was not a Boolean.
#### LOOPS ####
- Loops check a condition.If it is returns true, a code block will run.Then the condition will be checked again and if it still return true, the code block will run again.
1. For
A for loop is often used to loop through the items in an array. 
2. While
3. Do while
The key difference between a whi 1 e loop and a do whi 1e  loop is that the statements in the code block come before the condition. 
This means that those statements are run once whether or not the condition is met.
