##### Script #####
-A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
-scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step by step.
-To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 

##### Variables #####
-The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_).
-It must not start with a number. 
The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_).
Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
-You cannot use keywords or reserved words.
Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something.
-All variables are case sensitive,.
-Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. 
For example, firstName might be used to store a person's first name, lastNarne for their last name, and age for their age. 
-If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. 
For example, FirsttName rather than firsttnarne (this is referred to as camel case).
-You can also use an underscore between each word (you cannot use a dash). 
##### Array #####
-An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 
-You should consider using an array whenever you are working with a list or a set of values that are related to each other. 
-Arrays are especially helpful when you do not know how many items a list will contain because, when you create the array, you do not need to specify how many values it will hold. 
-Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). 
-Each item in an array is automatically given a number called an index.
-To retrieve the third item on the list, the array name is specified along with the index number in square brackets.
-Each array has a property called length, which holds the number of items in the array. 
##### Expression #####
-An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. 
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE. 
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE. 
##### Functions #####
-Browsers require very detailed instructions about what we want them to do.Therefore, complex scripts can run to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. 
Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.
-Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.
-If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
