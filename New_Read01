##### Structure #####
- In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey and to navigate around the document.
So, in order to learn how to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to structure documents. 
##### Structuring word documents #####
- The use of headings and subheadings in any document often reflects a hierarchy of information. 
- On the right, you can see a simple document in Microsoft Word.
##### HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.#####
- The HyperText part refers to the fact that HTML allows you to create links that allow visitors to move from one page to another quickly and easily. 
- A markup language allows you to annotate text, and these annotations provide additional meaning to the contents of a document. If you think of a web 
page, we add code around the original text we want to display and the browser then uses the code to display the page correctly. So the tags we add are the markup.
- HTML pages are text documents.
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes  X the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more  X about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are  X available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.
