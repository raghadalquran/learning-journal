### Growth Mindset ###
A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. **A growth mindset** is synonymous with a love of learning.

#### EXAMPLE: ####
When students believe they can get smarter, they understand that effort makes them stronger. Therefore they put in extra time and effort, and that leads to higher achievement.

### I'm always remind myself : ###
1. I always do my best.
2. I will get every thing i want,just i want to try.
3. I enjoy challenge.
