# Summary #
##### Color #####
+ Color can really bring your pages to life.
- The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element.
+ You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
1. rgb values.
- These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up.
- For example: rgb(100,100,90)
2. hex Codes.
- These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign.
- For example: #ee3e80
3. Color names.
- There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers.
- For example: DarkCyan
###### background-color ######
- You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names 
- By default, most browser windows have a white background, but browser users can set a background color for their windows, so if you want to be sure that the background is white  you can use the background-color property on the <body> element.
###### Contrast ######
- When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.
1. low Contrast
- Text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and foreground colors. 
2. high Contrast
- Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast between background and foreground colors.
3. medium Contrast
- For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability.
###### OPACITY ######
- The opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements.
- The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).
###### hsl Colors ######
1. Hue
Hue is the colloquial idea of color.
In HSL colors, hue is often represented as a color circle where the angle represents the color, although it may also be shown as a slider with values from 0 to 360.
2. saturation
Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. 
Saturation is represented as a percentage. 100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of gray.
3. lightness
Lightness is the amount of white  (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color. 
Lightness is represented as a percentage. 0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is normal.
Lightness is sometimes referred to as luminosity.
###### hsl, hsla ######
hsl
an alternative way to specify colors. 
The value of the property starts with the letters hsl, followed by individual values inside parentheses.
