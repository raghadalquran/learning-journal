- Introducing How Computers Work
A computer works by combining input, storage, processing, and output. All the main parts of a computer system are involved in one of these four processes. Input: Your keyboard and mouse, for example, are just input unitsâ€”ways of getting information into your computer that it can process.

- How Computers Work: What Makes a Computer, a Computer?
We know from this video see the 4 functions could these 4 functions apply to the same way the brain works for example the 4 are
Input -Study Environment, senses , emotions etc.
Storage -Short Term Memory, Long Term Memory
Processing- Thinking , Problem Solving and Developing
Output- Through these functions we perform our actions given for example homeworks, build ,create or do something.

- How Computers Work: Binary & Data
Computers process the binary data via electrical pulses. To represent a 0, we have no pulse, and a 1, we a pulse. If we wanted to have more numbers added, we would use different magnitudes of pulses. However, the transistors are so good they can't quite detect magnitudes of pulses that well, but really can only detect the presence of one. To make it easier to detect the magnitudes, we could have the voltage be higher. But, if the voltage is higher, so is the energy consumption of the computer. 
For this reason, computers just stick to the simplest number system they can, binary.

- How Computers Work: Circuits and Logic
One of the coolest things I've discovered about circuits is, circuitry can be an art form. 

- How Computers Work: CPU, Memory, Input & Output
The computer has to produce electrical signals to represent binary values, thus process the information.
There are two types of storage:
1. volatile, which requires electricity to remember the 0s and 1s (like RAM)
2. non-volatile, which doesn't require electricity to remember the 0s and 1s (like a hard drive, flash drive, floopy disk, mangnetic tape, ROM, CD , DVD, Blu Ray, etc.)

- How Computers Work: Hardware and Software
A program may implement an algorithm in a programming language. It can be reduced into a bunch of 1s and 0s that can be interpreted by a computer as executable instructions.
A file of executable instruction is known as an executable.
