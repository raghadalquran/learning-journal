# Summary #
##### THE DOCUMENT OBJECT REPRESENTS AN HTML PAGE #####
- Using the document object, you can access and change what content users see on the page and respond to how they interact with it.
Like other objects that represent real-world things, the document object has: 
- PROPERTIES 
Properties describe characteristics of the current web page (such as the title of the page). 
- METHODS 
Methods perform tasks associated with the document currently loaded in the browser (such as getting information from a specified element or adding new content). 
- EVENTS 
You can respond to events, such as a user clicking or tapping on an element. 
###### All major browsers use a JavaScript interpreter to translate your instructions (in JavaScript) into instructions the computer can follow. #####
When you use JavaScript in the browser, there is a part of the browser that is called an interpreter (or scripting engine). 
The interpreter takes your instructions (in JavaScript) and translates them into instructions the browser can use to achieve the tasks you want it to perform.
###### Web developers usually talk about three languages that are used to create web pages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. ######
PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT 
- These three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called progressive enhancement. 
- JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script. 
- You may see JavaScript in the HTML between opening <script> and closing </script> tags (but it is better to put scripts in their own files). 

 ###### COMMENTS ######
- You should write comments to explain what your code does.
- They help make your code easier to read and understand. 
- This can help you and others who read your code.
###### A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables. ######
###### variable ######
- A variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs. 
###### DATA TYPES ######
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans. 
1. NUMERIC DATA TYPE
2. STRING DATA TYPE
3. BOOLEAN DATA TYPE
